**Gerish** is a programming language that I am currently designing. This project is meant for learning, experimentation, and exploring how programming languages work under the hood.

This repository contains the source code of the interpreter written in C, made for Gerish.

**NOTE**

This project is primarily for personal learning and experimentation.
GerishLang is not intended for production use, but it may grow into a more complete language over time!

This project is open for personal study and use. Feel free to fork and experiment!
